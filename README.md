# scorereaper-scanner

This app originated with the need to capture stopwatch data, and points on a mobile app for sporting events
This data can then be synced to an backed database where the data can be parsed, and used as needed.

My end goal with this project is to create the solution end to end where the scoring can be seen near realtime 
on an cloud hosted website. All in the effort to eliminate using pen and paper to score.
